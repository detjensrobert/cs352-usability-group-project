  For the Pest Tracker application, our team created three mobile application designs, each focused on the communication between landlords and tenants surrounding the need for pest control. After multiple design iterations, we have decided on a final concept to iterate on and flesh out. This document details this improved design, and the tests we will use to evaluate its effectiveness.

# Introduction

The Pest Tracking System is a mobile- and web-based application that will ease the coordination between landlords and tenants when the need for pest control arises. Using a preference of either mobile push notifications, automated emails, or both, landlords and tenants can keep in contact about any pests located on the rented property and coordinate the delivery, installation, observation, and disposal of any pest traps required. The application will have an automated reminder system to remind users to keep track of when traps need to be checked or when they need to be replaced. In the case of an emergency, perhaps when a pest situation must be dealt with immediately, the tenant will be able to access a provided list of emergency pest control contacts which will be provided and maintained by the landlord.

Based on interviews and observations of the tenants and landlords, our group have a better understanding about the relationship between the tenants and the landlords. From this understanding, we created three revised designs. After peer feedback on these, we refined and combined our initial prototypes into one concept, presented in this document.

## Prototype URL

[Link to interactive Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/jtvyDb0Iw8zp9G3xuGY8DW/Concept---Week-6---Evaluation)

# Prototype Description

## 1. Login

The application starts at the login page, prompting the tenant to sign in with their phone number/email and password. They may also choose to sign up, or go through the "forgot password" process.

## 2. Sign Up

The second screen is the sign up page, where the tenant will provide their email address, phone number, and password to create an account with the service. The password is entered twice to confirm it was entered correctly. There is a back button at the top left of the page which will clear the form and return to the login page.

## 3. Landing Page

The main page, shown after logging in or when opening the app if a user is already logged in, provides the tenant with quick actions for the three functions this app provides. These are: file a new report of a pest problem, view previously reported pest problems, or access general communication between the user and their landlord. There is a settings button at the top left which opens the settings overlay.

## 4. New Report

This screen allows the tenant to file a new pest control report. The page requires the user to provide:

- a written description of the issue
- the type of pest being reported via a dropdown menu
- the affected location(s) via a dropdown menu
- attached images of the pest and its location

A back button is located at the top left of the screen which will cancel the report and return to the main page. The confirm button in the top right creates the new report and sends it to the landlord.

## 5. Past Reports

The past reports screen will show the list of all previous pest control reports filed by the tenant, sorted by date. Each report can be selected to view the information in more detail. A back button in the top left corner will return the user to the main page.

## 6. Report Details

This screen will allow the tenant to view what information they provided for the selected pest report. A back button is located in the top left corner which will return the user to the user to the Past Reports page.

## 7. General Chat

This screen will function as a chat application between the user and landlord, much like an IM messenger such as Discord or Slack. Messages from the landlord and tenant are shown in different colors as to easily distinguish between users. There is a text box at the bottom of the page for the tenant to compose new messages, and an attach button (the paperclip) will open a file selector to attach files to the message.

## 8. Settings

This state is an overlay that appears on the main page. The tenants name and profile picture are displayed at the top, with an option to edit their information below. A following button will take the tenant to the past reports page. The overlay can be closed by tapping outside the overlay or via the back button located at the top right.

## 9. Settings Logout Confirmation

This state exists between the setting state and the login page. Its purpose is to keep the tenant from accidentally logging themselves out of the application when in the settings state by asking for a confirmation of their choice.

## 10. Help Page

The help page is a collection of resources for the user in regards to the application. There is an FAQ that will open to a website with a list of frequently asked questions. Contact Support will open the user's email program to send an email to the developers.

# Usability Test Plan

To evaluate the effectiveness of this app prototype, the team will be conducting user observations to observe how effective our application is, and whether our functionalities require improvements. In order to achieve this usability testing, the team will be observing how participates react when using the prototype, and have the participants share their thoughts about the application after the evaluation. Additionally, we will record any issues from the participants' experiences in order to identify the parts of the applications that users have trouble with. The team will ask the participant a questionnaire after the evaluation. The end goal of this usability testing will be identifying the portions of the app that hinder the user experience. With this in mind, the team will have different components for usability testing purposes.

**Components:**

- Research Subjects

- User Scenarios

- User Tasks

- Research Methods

## Research Subjects

Currently, our team are planning to conduct usability testing with three subjects from our target audience. These subjects are college students, considering many are living out of campus and live under contract with a landlord. By conducting usability testing with the subjects, the constant communication between the subjects and the team will allow accurate feedback on the application. Subjects will be recruited through an existing university social media community on Discord.

Due to the current complication with COVID-19, the usability testing will be conducted remotely to ensure safety for both the subjects and the team. The testing will be done with the Figma prototype detailed previously in this report and the Appendix. As this will be delivered remotely, the meeting will be held through Zoom or Discord to allow for the participants and the Team to interact. Additionally, the subjects will be asked to share their screen while interacting with the prototype in order to show how they interact with the prototype. Before the evaluation, the subjects will be asked for consent to perform and record the evaluation so the team can use the session for analysis.

## User Scenarios

- Filing a new pest report

- Accessing past pest reports using two different methods

## User Tasks



## Research Methods

For testing usability, we will be using post-test questionnaire and critical thinking as our research methods. By having
the participants express their thoughts as they go along it will give us insights into the mental model they have of the
application. We can see where they are successful and where they struggle along the way instead of relying on their
recall at the end. In addition we will ask questions at the end to make sure we cover certain areas if the user didnâ€™t
report anything about them during the experiment.

- Post-test Questions:

1. What are your thoughts on our application?
2. Would you use this application if it was available for your device?
3. What are your thoughts on our screens?
4. How did using the app make you feel?
5. What did you think about how long it took you to complete the tasks?
6. Which screens did you like the best or least?
7. If the app was designed specifically for you what would you like to see in it?
8. If a person you know was using the app what do you think that they would like to see in it?
9. What changes would you like to see?
10. What would make you want to use the app more?
11. What are your thoughts on the colors used in the app?
12. What did you think about the icons in the app?
13. What are your thoughts on the organization/layout of the screens?
14. What are your thoughts on the name of the application?
15. What do you think about the size of the font used?
16. Is there anything else you would like to share about the app?
