## Project Idea

We will be using Robert's idea for a landlord/tenat interaction service with a focus on bedbug tracking:

> Landlords commonly need to track the occurrences of bedbugs across their holdings. This application will serve as away
> for landlords and tenants to track bedbug infestations and catch them in the early stages before costly fumigation is
> needed.
>
> Bedbug infestations are very costly and time-consuming to treat once a colony has been established, and treatment can
> have side effects for furniture and such in the treatment area. If the presence of bedbugs can be caught before it
> gets out of control, treatment is much simpler.
>
> There is a opportunity for a service that in essence offers bedbug traps-as-a-service; where a landlord can arrange
> for traps to be delivered to clients, clients to monitor the traps and report back pictures of the traps to their
> landlords.
>
> While there are services that allow for user-provided bedbug reports, they do not offer trap ordering and per-trap
> tracking along with landlord integration.

## Communication

### 1. Coordination?

We have a created a Discord server for this project and will be coordinating meetings and work and such there.

### 2. Weekly meeting?

Not yet, but likely sometime Tu/Th. We will be meeting over Discord as that is where we are most active and comfortable
with.

### 3. Shared workspace?

We have a Github repo for all of our work, and all the tools that come with that: issue tracking, project board, code
review, etc. This is a private repo as to not invite plagiarism, but if the instructor or TA needs access we will invite
them.
